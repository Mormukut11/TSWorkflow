# TSWorkflow

**TSWorkflow** contains the **[code](Code.gs)** for the [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/) workflow automation highlighted in my presentation given at **[SheetsCon-2020](https://sheetscon.com/)** - **"Automation with Apps Script"**.  

<br>


**TSWorkflow** showcases the power of **[Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script)** to automate [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/) workflow using:  

| GOOGLE FORMS | GOOGLE SHEETS | GOOGLE DOCS | GOOGLE DRIVE | GMAIL |

> :point_right: See this **[blog post]()** for the **TSWorkflow overview** and **getting started guide**.

<br>

> :point_right: TSWorkflow demonstrates modern [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) features supported by the new [Apps Script V8 Javascript runtime](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/v8-runtime).  See this **[code](NoV8.gs)** if you're looking for the non-V8 version of TSWorkflow.

## Important Notes

* TSWorkflow is meant to *demonstate* [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/) workflow automation with [Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) and ***should not*** be deployed in a production environment without further development and test. 

* TSWorkflow demonstrates workflow automation with __Google Drive > My Drive__.  Code modifications are needed to enable its use with [Shared drives](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7212025?hl=en).

* If TSWorkflow does not appear to be working correctly, check the [Apps Script Dashboard](https://script.google.com) for execution errors.
